I'm a third year Ph.D. student in the [Data and Web Science Group](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws) at the University of Mannheim, under the supervision of Professor Heiner Stuckenschmidt. Previously, I was a research scientist at [NEC Laboratories Europe](https://www.neclab.eu/). 

My primary research focus revolves around temporal Knowledge Graphs. Specifically, I am intrigued by temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting and the evaluation of methods in this research domain. 

Besides research, I like music, food, and boats.

### Check out TGB 2.0: A benchmark for learning on Temporal Knowledge Graphs and Heterogeneous Graphs
* [TGB 2.0](https://tgb.complexdatalab.com/) extends the Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB) to multi-relational graphs, offering a collection of challenging and diverse datasets for Temporal Heterogeneous Graphs and Temporal Knowledge Graphs. 
* Our goal is to provide a realistic, reproducible, and robust evaluation platform for machine learning on temporal multi-relational graphs.

### History repeats itself: A Baseline for Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting at IJCAI 2024
* Our* Paper *History repeats itself: A Baseline for Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting* was accepted at IJCAI 2024.
*Julia Gastinger, Christian Meilicke, Federico Errica, Timo Sztyler, Anett Schuelke, Heiner Stuckenschmidt
* We propose a baseline for TKG Foreacsting based on the simple principle of recurrency. Surprisingly, this simple approach beats state of the art methods on 3 out of 5 commonly used datasets!

### Internship in MontrÃ©al
* In spring 2024, I did a 2-month research internship at [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/) and University of MontrÃ©al, supervised by Prof. Guillaume Rabusseau.
* During the internship I worked on benchmarking Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting Methods. 
* Further, I focused on eating as many different Poutines as possible - yeahi.

### Comparing Apples and Oranges? On the Evaluation of Methods for Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting at ECML PKDD 2023
* Our* Paper *Comparing Apples and Oranges? On the Evaluation of Methods for Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting* 
was accepted at ECML PKDD 2023.
*Julia Gastinger, Timo Sztyler, Lokesh Sharma, Anett Schuelke, Heiner Stuckenschmidt
* In this work we focus on the evaluation of TKG Forecasting models: we highlight existing issues, propose a unified evaluation protocol, and apply it to re-evaluate state-of-the-art models.

## Temporal Graph Learning Reading Group

If you share an interest in Temporal Graph Learning, I invite you to check out and join our [Temporal Graph Reading Group](https://shenyanghuang.github.io/rg.html). We meet every Thursday at 11 am EDT (5 pm CST) on Zoom, where authors of insightful and recent Temporal Graph Learning Papers present their work. The reading group is organized by Shenyang (Andy) Huang, Farimah Poursafaei, and myself.
