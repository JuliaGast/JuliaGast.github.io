I'm a research scientist at [NEC Laboratories Europe](https://www.neclab.eu/) and a second year Ph.D. student in the [Data and Web Science Group](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws) at the University of Mannheim, under the supervision of Professor Heiner Stuckenschmidt.

My primary research focus revolves around temporal Knowledge Graphs. Specifically, I am intrigued by temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting and the evaluation of methods in this research domain. Prior to my position at NEC Laboratories Europe, I completed a master's degree in Engineering Cybernetics at the University of Stuttgart, specializing in Autonomous Systems and Control Theory.

Besides research, I like music, food, and boats.

### I'm going to Montréal!
In spring 2024 I will do a 2-month research internship at [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/) and University of Montréal, supervised by Prof. Guillaume Rabusseau.
During the internship I work on benchmarking Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting Methods. 
Further, I focus on eating as many different Poutines as possible - yeahi.

## Temporal Graph Learning Reading Group

If you share an interest in Temporal Graph Learning, I invite you to check out and join our [Temporal Graph Reading Group](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~shuang43/rg.html). We meet every Thursday at 11 am EDT (5 pm CST) on Zoom, where authors of insightful and recent Temporal Graph Learning Papers present their work. The reading group is organized by Shenyang (Andy) Huang, Farimah Poursafaei, and myself.
