I'm a third year Ph.D. student in the [Data and Web Science Group](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws) at the University of Mannheim, under the supervision of Professor Heiner Stuckenschmidt. Previously, I was a research scientist at [NEC Laboratories Europe](https://www.neclab.eu/). 

My primary research focus revolves around temporal Knowledge Graphs. Specifically, I am intrigued by temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting and the evaluation of methods in this research domain. 

Besides research, I like music, food, and boats.

###  ![alt text](image.png) Top Reviewer Award @ LOG 2024 
* I'm honored to be recognized as one of the top reviewers at the [Learning on Graphs Conference 2024](https://logconference.org/).
* Huge thanks to the organizers for putting together such an awesome event.

###  ![alt text](image.png) Dynamic Representations of Global Crises: A Temporal Knowledge Graph For Conflicts, Trade and Value Networks @ LOG 2024 
* Our Paper *Dynamic Representations of Global Crises: A Temporal Knowledge Graph For Conflicts, Trade and Value Networks* was accepted at the Learning on Graphs Conference 2024.
* We create and analyze a Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) containing data on worldwide crises and trade over time, and apply TKG forecasting methods to it.

### ![alt text](image-1.png) TGB 2.0: A Benchmark for Learning on Temporal Knowledge Graphs and Heterogeneous Graphs @ NeurIPS 2024
![alt text](image-17.png)
* Our Paper was accepted at the NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks Track 
* [TGB 2.0](https://tgb.complexdatalab.com/) extends the Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB) to multi-relational graphs, offering a collection of challenging and diverse datasets for Temporal Heterogeneous Graphs and Temporal Knowledge Graphs. 
* Our goal is to provide a realistic, reproducible, and robust evaluation platform for machine learning on temporal multi-relational graphs.

###  ![alt text](image.png) History repeats itself: A Baseline for Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting @ IJCAI 2024 
* Our Paper *History repeats itself: A Baseline for Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting* was accepted at IJCAI 2024.
* We propose a baseline for TKG Foreacsting based on the simple principle of recurrency. Surprisingly, this simple approach beats state of the art methods on 3 out of 5 commonly used datasets!

### ![alt text](image-13.png) Internship in MontrÃ©al! 
* In spring 2024, I did a 2-month research internship at [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/) and University of MontrÃ©al, supervised by Prof. Guillaume Rabusseau.
* During the internship I worked on benchmarking Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting Methods. 
* Further, I focused on eating as many different Poutines as possible - yeahi.

### ![alt text](image-10.png)![alt text](image-9.png) Comparing Apples and Oranges? On the Evaluation of Methods for Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting @ ECML PKDD 2023 
* Our Paper *Comparing Apples and Oranges? On the Evaluation of Methods for Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting* 
was accepted at ECML PKDD 2023.
* Authors: Julia Gastinger, Timo Sztyler, Lokesh Sharma, Anett Schuelke, Heiner Stuckenschmidt
* In this work we focus on the evaluation of TKG Forecasting models: we highlight existing issues, propose a unified evaluation protocol, and apply it to re-evaluate state-of-the-art models.

## Temporal Graph Learning Reading Group

If you share an interest in Temporal Graph Learning, I invite you to check out and join our [Temporal Graph Reading Group](https://shenyanghuang.github.io/rg.html). We meet every Thursday at 11 am EDT (5 pm CST) on Zoom, where authors of insightful and recent Temporal Graph Learning Papers present their work. The reading group is organized by Shenyang (Andy) Huang, Farimah Poursafaei, and myself.
