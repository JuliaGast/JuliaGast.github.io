Hi, I'm Julia.

I'm a research scientist at NEC Laboratories Europe and a second year Ph.D. student in the Data and Web Science Group at University of Mannheim, supervised by Professor Heiner Stuckenschmidt.

My research primarily focuses on temporal Knowledge Graphs – Specifically, I'm interested in temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting and the evaluation of methods in this research field. 
Prior to joining NEC Laboratories Europe, I graduated with a master’s degree from University of Stuttgart, where I studied Engineering Cybernetics with a focus on Autonomous Systems and Control Theory.
